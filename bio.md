## Goals
I would like to make a career out of the military and eventually retire in the Philippines or Japan. Among some of my many goals I'd like to retire in the Marine Corps as a Colonel and move to the Philippines or Japan and start a resort. I am currently working on obtaining a Bachelors Degree in Business Management.

## Interests

OF my many interests I enjoy working out, studying, goal setting and traveling the world. If possible I would love to travel to at least 30 countries before the age of 40. So far I have travelled to Japan, Canada, Mexico, Thailand, Australia, The United Emirates, Taiwan and South Korea. I have a scuba diving license but have not been scuba diving as much as I'd like to.
